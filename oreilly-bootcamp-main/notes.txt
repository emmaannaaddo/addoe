sam's note dump

using colab
- can't use rise anymore

non-standard packages we need:
- otter-grader
- rise

about lab01:
- basically copied from lec05 and 06 from dsc 10.
- using RISE since the lab is primarily about writing code, so it'll be easier not to have to flip back and forth a bunch
- ugh, don't really like nba players example but i don't have enough time to make another one.
